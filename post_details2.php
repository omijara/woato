           Wholesale market “Kawran bazar”, everything you will find there also the possibility of get infected by Corona… Not possible to lockdown this wholesale market but possible to help these helpless daily labors over there to protect from Corona.It’s really difficult to make these people understand about the risk but we could provide at least the basic for their survival which also save us as we are also going there. Big Thanks to all of you for your support including wishes.
